# TSG101_GR_2021-Biochemistry
This is a compilation of files used to analyze data in my 2021 Biochemistry article on two proteins, TSG101 and GR

* The Mathematica notebooks are global analyses of multiple datasets (Hence the "OghmaInfinium" reference in the names). Each dataset is an observation of fluorescence anisotropy of some labeled molecule, either TSG101cc or GRE DNA, while another molecule, some construct of GR, is titrated out of solution.
* The Python notebook is a simulation of how GR's DNA binding could be expected to change in the presence/absence of an NTD binding partner, all based on the Ensemble Allostery Model of GR
